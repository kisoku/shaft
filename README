== Shaft ==

shaft(1) is a super minimal IPsec tunnel manager for OpenBSD built
on top of OpenSSH. shaft is largely derived from OpenSSH's sftp subsystem.

Currently shaft is only supported on OpenBSD and requires OpenBSD's
ipsecctl(8) utility to operate correctly.

In order to build shaft you will need a full checkout of the OpenBSD
source tree.

# tar zxf src.tar.gz -C /usr/src

Additionally ssh must be built in order for shaft to compile successfully

$ cd /usr/src/usr.bin/ssh
$ make obj
$ make depends
$ make

You will need to copy the shaft source directory to /usr/src/usr.sbin

$ git clone git://github.com/kisoku/shaft
$ sudo cp -R shaft /usr/src/usr.sbin/
$ cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/shaft
$ make obj
$ make depend
$ sudo make install

In order for shaft-server(8) to function you will need to add the
following line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart sshd.

Subsystem 	shaft	/usr/libexec/shaft-server

Shaft is client-server based IPsec tunnel manager that
erects a ESP tunnel between two hosts. It uses aesctr as the
encryption algorithm and hmac-sha2-256 as the authentication
algorithm. Shaft currently requires root privileges on both
sides of the connection and will not attempt to rekey,
gracefully degrade or buy you a pony. Shaft is under active
development.

If you want to use shaft to protect traffic between two
networks, learn how to use gif(4).

== Example ==
from your client connect to the shaft server.

$ sudo shaft root@192.168.254.44
$ sudo ipsecctl -sa
FLOWS:
flow esp in from 192.168.254.44 to 192.168.254.98 peer 192.168.254.44 type require
flow esp out from 192.168.254.98 to 192.168.254.44 peer 192.168.254.44 type require
flow esp in proto tcp from 192.168.254.44 port ssh to 192.168.254.98 type bypass
flow esp out proto tcp from 192.168.254.98 to 192.168.254.44 port ssh type bypass

SAD:
esp tunnel from 192.168.254.44 to 192.168.254.98 spi 0x23b599ef auth hmac-sha2-256 enc aesctr
esp tunnel from 192.168.254.98 to 192.168.254.44 spi 0x964f1438 auth hmac-sha2-256 enc aesctr
