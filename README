== Shaft == 

shaft(1) is a super minimal IPsec tunnel manager for OpenBSD built
on top of OpenSSH. shaft is largely derived from OpenSSH's sftp subsystem.

Currently shaft is only supported on OpenBSD and requires OpenBSD's
ipsecctl(8) utility to operate correctly. 

In order to build shaft you will need a full checkout of the OpenBSD
source tree. 

# tar zxf src.tar.gz -C /usr/src

Additionally ssh must be built in order for shaft to compile successfully

$ cd /usr/src/usr.bin/ssh
$ make obj
$ make depends 
$ make

You will need to copy the shaft source directory to /usr/src/usr.sbin
$ git clone git://github.com/kisoku/shaft
$ sudo cp -R shaft /usr/src/usr.sbin/
$ cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/shaft
$ make obj
$ make depend
$ sudo make install

In order for shaft-server(8) to function you will need to add the 
following line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart sshd.

Subsystem 	shaft	/usr/libexec/shaft-server
